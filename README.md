# wp-swipe-slider
**May not work for all sites - needs more testing. I don't recommend using it for now unless you're willing to mess around with it.**

Simple WordPress plugin implementation of the Swipe slider (https://github.com/lyfeyaj/swipe). Designed to work with the WordPress block editor (Gutenberg). Simply create a gallery block and add the class "swipe-slideshow" to it and it will become a slideshow.
